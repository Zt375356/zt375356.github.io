**Status**: Submitted to *IMWUT (CCF A)*.

Completed during internship at **Tsinghua University (Feb 2025 - Jun 2025)**.
I was responsible for building a multi-modal physiological dataset from scratch and exploring efficient alignment and fusion strategies for two modalities with significant saliency differences, effectively improving downstream task performance.
