Start from the accumulation of academic research, I have made significant breakthroughs in my academic achievements. During my master's degree, supported by my laboratory team, I participated in publishing/submitting **8 academic papers**. Among them, I am the **first author or co-first author of 4 papers**, with **2 papers officially accepted**. My research covers multiple directions such as **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Time Series Analysis**, and **UAV Control**.

I actively participate in cross-university research internships to broaden my academic horizon. 
*   **Feb 2025 - Jun 2025**: Research Intern at **Tsinghua University** (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Pervasive Computing, Ministry of Education). Focused on multi-modal physiological perception algorithms for mobile phones.
*   **Jul 2025 - Nov 2025**: Research Intern at **Renmin University of China** (School of Information, AIM3 Lab). Focused on Embodied AI and Visual Imitation Learning.

I investigate efficient alignment and fusion strategies, and build low-cost frameworks for robot imitation learning. My work aims to verify feasibility in real-world tasks and lower the barrier for technology deployment.
